//README - MyID

A web application designed to help me track my progress leading up to the Irish Dance National Championships this summer! Planned features include a countdown (to the second!), an interactive training calendar, a local competition results tracker, and motivational images and quotes. My goal is to qualify for the world championships next year. Currently a work in progress.
